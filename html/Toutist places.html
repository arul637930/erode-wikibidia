    <center><h2>Kodiveri Dam</h2></center>
    <center><img src="../assests/kodivery.jpg" alt=""></center>
    <p>Discover a picturesque dam and waterfall nestled in the scenic Erode district near Satyamangalam, just a short distance from Coimbatore and Erode. This popular tourist spot not only boasts of stunning views but also provides water for irrigation to over 25000 hectares of land. At the base of the dam, a lively park awaits with an array of thrilling attractions, rides, and games for visitors to enjoy. Come and experience the beauty and excitement of this must-see destination.</p>
    <p>Kongalvan Vettuva Gounder King built the dam in the year 1125 AD. A 20-foot rock wall was carved out in order to build the dam. Iron bars were then used to interlock the stones, and lead was used as mortar. The small waterfall created by the flowing river water from the other side of the dam is purely a delight to the eyes.</p>
    <p>As it is not particularly heavy, the bubbling, flowing water falls to the earth gently. A dip in the falls is safe, and you can even go swimming here, which would be a memorable experience. Coracle rowers sell freshly caught fish which you can buy and enjoy cooking live. The entry fee costs only Rs.5 per person. Both government-allocated car parking and private car parking are available at Rs.20 and Rs.30 respectively. In the upper part of the dam, coracle rides are provided for Rs.50 per person for a roundtrip.</p>
    <address><mark>Kodiveri Dam is well-connected by road. You can take a bus from Erode, Coimbatore or nearby towns to reach the dam.</mark></address>
